      <p>I am a second year Master’s student in Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. I have been working as a Research Assistant at <a href="http://svl.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Stanford Vision and Learning Lab (SVL) </a> under supervision of <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/" target="_blank"> Prof. Silvio Savarese </a> since November 2017. I devote most of my time to the <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/projects/jackrabbot/" target="_blank"> JackRabbot </a> project. Prior to joining Stanford, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon for 2 years where I was a part of the Prime Video team and Fulfillment Center Technologies team.</p>

      <p>I received my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India, where I worked on writing parallel and distributed versions of dimensionality reduction algorithms. I have spent a summer at <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/melady.html" target="_blank">USC Melady lab</a> working under guidance of Prof. Yan Liu on studying techniques to improve convergence of stochastic gradient descent algorithm on heavy-tailed distributions. I have also interned at <a href="http://www.barc.gov.in/" target="_blank">Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai</a> in 2013.</p>

      <p> My research interests include Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. I am interested in understanding </p>

        <h5><b>Defendr: A robust model for Image Classification</b></h5>
        <i> CS 231n Course Project with Apoorva Dornadula and Akhila Yerukola, Stanford University </i>
        <br>
         We implemented an image classification model that is robust to black-box adversarial attacks like FGSM and PGD. The model uses a DUNet to denoise adversarial images. It also uses adversarial logit pairing in the objective to train a robust classifier. The model was able to achieve classification accuracy of 86.6% on tiny ImageNet (12,000 data points, 300 classes). This work was selected as the second best poster.

        <h5> <b> Visual Question Answering </b></h5>
        <i> CS 224n Course Project with Stefanie Anna, Stanford University </i> <br>
        We implemented a visual question answering system that can provide single-word answer for a wide-variety of questions about an image. The model used Stacked Attention Network and was able to achieve accuracy of 47.11% on VQA v2.

        <h5> <b> Automated Question Answering </b></h5> 
        <i> CS 221 Course Project with Amita Kamath and Akhila Yerukola, Stanford University </i> <br>
        Suggested modifications to Dynamic Memory Network (DMN+) that improved convergence rate (upto 20% on 18 QA tasks) and improved accuracy (2% - 6% on 4 QA tasks) on bAbI-10k dataset.

        <h5> <b> Deep Reinforcement Learning for long term strategy games </b></h5>
        <i> CS 229 Course Project with Akhila Yerukola and Megha Jhunjhunwala, Stanford University </i> <br>
        We implemented a hierarchical DQN on Atari Montezuma’s Revenge and compared the performance with other algorithms like DQN, A3C and A3C-CTS. The agent learnt a strategy to cross the first room and get a consistent reward.

        <h5><b>Analysis of Emergent Behavior in Multi Agent Environments using Deep RL</b></h5>
        <i> CS 234 Course Project with Stefanie Anna, Stanford University </i> <br>
        Implemented parameter-sharing DQN, DDQN and DRQN for multi-agent environments and analysed the evolution of complex group behaviors on multi-agent environments like Battle, Pursuit and Gathering. We observed emergence of interesting group behaviors in these games. In Battle, the particles learnt to cooperate to success- fully capture and kill the particles of the opponent team. In Pursuit, we observed that the predators learned to cooperate and form enclosures to trap the prey.

        <h5><b>Parallelizing Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms</b></h5>
        I worked on designing and implementing multi-core, multi-node and hybrid (multi-node + multi-core) implementations of PCA and SVD for dense matrices using algorithm for parallel TSQR factorization proposed by A. R. Benson et. al. in “Direct QR factorizations for tall-and-skinny matrices in MapReduce architectures.” I was able to achieve an average speedup of 4X in SVD and 8X in PCA for dense matrices of size up to 100 billion rows X 48 columns.

      <p>
        <h5><b>Robust Stochastic Gradient Descent</b></h5>
        I worked on designing and implementing an algorithm for robust Stochastic Gradient Descent that aimed at improving the convergence rate of SGD on datasets with large variance and on heavy taled distributions. We were able to achieve upto 1.5x speedup on a randomly generated synthetic dataset of size 1000 with 50 random outliers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5><b>Library for Online Adaptive Subgradient Methods</b></h5>
        I implemented a C++ library for adaptive subgradient methods with primal-dual gradient update and composite mirror descent update for L1, L1-ball projection, L2 and L∞ regularization. These online algorithms were based on work by John Duchi et. al. in “Adaptive Subgradient Methods for Online Learning and Stochastic Optimization”.

        <h5><b>Personalizing search results on the basis of user's Twitter activity</b></h5>
        Performed concept tagging on the content of tweets and re-tweets to obtain concepts associated with a user. Performed taxonomical classification of these concepts into ∼ 30 broad classes and generated user-interest profiles. Re-ranked the search-results returned by search-engines on the basis of user's interest profile. Peri- odically updated the user profiles to account for variation in interests.

        <h5><b>Implementation of Parallel Page Rank algorithm</b></h5>
        Implemented multi-node, multi-core and hybrid (multi-node + multi-core) implementations of per- sonalized PageRank algorithm. Validated correctness of algorithm for datasets with spider-traps, disconnected components and dead-ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h5><b>Implementation of compiler for a custom language</b> [<i>Jan - April 2014</i>]</h5>
         Implemented a compiler for a custom Matlab-like language. This was a team project and I focussed on implementing lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree and code generator.
