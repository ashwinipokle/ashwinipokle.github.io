# my website

This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [this repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

The website design is a modification of [Leonid Keselman's website](https://leonidk.com/) which was adapted from  [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/) and is converted for my own use.
