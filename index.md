I am a first year Master's student in Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. Prior to joining Stanford, I worked as a Software Development Engineer with Amazon Development Center, Bangalore for 2 years. While at Amazon, I got opportunity to work with the Prime Video team and Fulfillment Center Technologies team. 

I completed my undergraduate studies at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India. I have spent a summer at [USC Melady lab](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/melady.html) working under guidance of Prof. Yan Liu on studying techniques to improve convergence of stochastic gradient descent algorithm on heavy-tailed distributions. I have also interned at [BARC, Mumbai](http://www.barc.gov.in/) in 2013.

My research interests spans Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I am also interested in researching techniques to improve security of Machine Learning systems.
