I am a first year Master's student in Department of Computer Science at Stanford University. Prior to joining Stanford, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Development Center, Bangalore for 2 years where I was a part of the Prime Video team and Fulfillment Center Technologies team. 

I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/), India, where I worked on writing parallel and distributed versions of dimensionality reduction algorithms. I have spent a summer at [USC Melady lab](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~liu32/melady.html) working under guidance of Prof. Yan Liu on studying techniques to improve convergence of stochastic gradient descent algorithm on heavy-tailed distributions. I have also interned at [BARC, Mumbai](http://www.barc.gov.in/) in 2013.

My research interests span Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning. I am interested in researching applications of Deep Learning in Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning. I also interested in studying techniques to improve security and robustness of Machine Learning systems.
